3 Observations or Insights:



1.) On the mouse weight versus average tumor volume for drug regimen Capomulin, the scatter plot indicates that mouse weight might have a connection to the tumor volume. As the weight of the mouse goes higher, the average tumor volume gets larger. As in Capomulin example, the correction between mouse weight and average tumore volume is 0.84.


2.) Mice ID g989 have five set of duplicate records with the same ID and Timepoint. The values on these duplicate Mice ID and Timepoint are very close. By dropping either one of the records in the duplicate set would not skew the results.

3.) According to the final timepoint for all four top drugs, Ramicane should be the most promising drug regimen for tumor. This drug regimen has the smallest average tumor volume on the final endpoint.
